    <h3>Q: 	Can I use a clicker device from another vendor (CPS, PRS Interwrite, H-ITT, etc)?</h3><br />
<h2>A: 	No, you must use a Turning Technologies (Response Innovations) RF clicker in classrooms at Miami University. Virtual clickers are available that will run on smartphones, laptops, iPods, etc. You pay for a license to use these devices as a clicker instead of buying a physical clicker, like the XR model available at bookstores and online.  ResponseWare can be purchased for one year at a price of $15 or $32 for a 4 year license.</h2><br />
<h3>Q:	Can I sell my clicker to another student? </h3><br />
<h2>A: 	Absolutely. There is nothing preventing you from using a clicker obtained from another student. You can register it in Niihka just as its former owner did, and use it in your classes. If the former owner put his/her personal info in the clicker (username, first and last name), then you can simply enter your information overwriting that of the former owner.  This can be changed by going into Setup  User Data  Edit</h2><br />
<h3>Q:	Can I share my clicker with another student?</h3><br />
<h2>A: 	Yes, you and your friend can each register and use the clicker in your respective classes. You May Not share a device within the same class, as it is not possible for a single clicker to be registered to two students in the same class in Niihka. Niihka may let you register the same device, but when the professor goes to download and import his/her participant list, TurningPoint will throw an error.  (Also of note, if the instructor is using a combined Niihka site, this information may not apply and sharing may not be possible even in different sections of the same class).</h2><br />
<h3>Q: 	Where can I buy a clicker and how much do they cost?</h3><br />
<h2>A:	You can buy one at any of the three bookstores in Oxford (Shriver, Folletts, and DuBois). The bookstore price, for a new clicker, is about 53 dollars. You can buy them online as well for 40 dollars plus about 5 dollars shipping. The online store can be accessed at https://store.turningtechnologies.com/index.cfm . Enter “p1vn” when prompted for Miami’s school code. You can also buy virtual clickers from the store. Email Ricardo at madurorr@muohio.edu for more info about this.  When reselling to the bookstore expect to get around 26 dollars. When classes at the regionals adopt TurningPoint, expect to find them for sale in the bookstores in Hamilton and Middletown.</h2><br />
