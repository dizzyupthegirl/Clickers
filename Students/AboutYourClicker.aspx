    <h2> 
        These are the devices you&#39;ll be working with. There are two types of clickers 
        shown, it is possible for you to have either one of these models. The 
        first, an NXT is newer and allows for easier polling in some situations, such as 
        Self Paced testing. The second, an XR, has been the university standard for a 
        while now and is the more common model. Before purchasing, you may want to ask your professor if they have a 
        model preference</h2>


    <h4><u>Registering Your Clicker on Niihka</u></h4>

    <br />
    The process to register is as follows:
    <br />
    1.	Go to Class Website tab on Niihka(ex: CSE 174) 
    <br />

     <br />
    3. You'll have two options at the top of the page here, Response Device or ResponseWare. If you are using one of 
     the devices pictured at the top of this page, click Response Device  
     <br />

        style="height: 300px; width: 893px" />
     <br />
    4. Enter your Device ID. This ID will be on the back of your clicker, for example, it will say something like Deivce ID: 0F67B2. 
     All device ID's will be 6 characters long.

    <h4> <u>Setting the Channel</u></h4>
        <h3>What do you mean "channel"?</h3>
        <h2> 
        For the hardware to work properly, it must be set to the channel assigned to the room you're in. If you choose your own channel, there's a 
        chance that a room nearby may already be using that channel and you could pick up responses from their class. You set the channel on the receiver through
        Turning Point, and then the students can set the channel on their device to the channel you set the receiver to. (See Student: All About Your Clicker for 
        information on how to set the channel on clickers).
