    <h2> 
        These are the devices you&#39;ll be working with. There are two types of clickers 
        shown, it is possible for you to have either one of these models. The 
        first, an NXT is newer and allows for easier polling in some situations, such as 
        Self Paced testing. The second, an XR, has been the university standard for a 
        while now and is the more common model. Before purchasing, you may want to ask your professor if they have a 
        model preference</h2>

        <h2> 
        Every room on campus is assigned a specifc channel, that way we ensure there is no over lap in close by rooms having the same channel,
        and thus eliminating teh possibility of one professor picking up another classes responses. Your professor will tell you teh channel, or it will be 
        posted somewhere around your classroom.
