        These are the devices you&#39;ll be working with. There are two types of clickers 
        shown, it is possible for students to have either one of these models. The 
        first, an NXT is newer and allows for easier polling in some situations, such as 
        Self Paced testing. The second, an XR, has been the university standard for a 
        while now and is the more common model. The receiver is what you&#39;ll plug into 
        the computer to allow students to answer questions with their clickers.</p>
